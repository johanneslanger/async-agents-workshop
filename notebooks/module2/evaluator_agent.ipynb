    "## The \"Agent as Tool\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Agent as Tool\" pattern is an architectural approach where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A primary agent handles the main task and determines when to call specialized agents\n",
    "2. Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the primary agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent has a focused area of responsibility\n",
    "- **Specialized expertise**: Agents can be optimized for specific tasks with tailored system prompts\n",
    "- **Hierarchical delegation**: Clear chain of command for complex tasks\n",
    "- **Modular architecture**: Specialists can be added, removed, or modified independently\n",
    "- **Improved quality**: Multiple agents can provide checks and balances\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: Agents can learn from each other's outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll create:\n",
    "- A content evaluator agent specialized in ensuring posts adhere to brand guidelines\n",
    "- A feedback loop where the post generator can revise content based on evaluator feedback"

    "1. **Separation of concerns**:\n",
    "   - The post generator focuses on creativity and content creation\n",
    "   - The evaluator focuses on ensuring brand guideline adherence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specialized expertise**:\n",
    "   - Each agent has a tailored system prompt optimized for its specific task\n",
    "   - The evaluator has detailed knowledge of brand guidelines\n",
    "   - The generator has creative freedom within defined constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feedback loops**:\n",
    "   - The generator can learn from the evaluator's feedback\n",
    "   - Content quality improves through iterative refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modular architecture**:\n",
    "   - We can modify the evaluator's guidelines without changing the generator\n",
    "   - We could add additional specialized agents (e.g., a hashtag generator, image suggester)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quality control**:\n",
    "   - Posts are vetted before publishing\n",
    "   - Brand consistency is maintained\n",

    "This pattern mimics human team dynamics, where a creative writer might submit content to an editor for review before publication. The multi-agent approach allows for checks and balances that improve the overall quality of the output."

    "1. An evaluator agent specialized in ensuring posts adhere to brand guidelines\n",
    "2. An enhanced post generator that uses the evaluator as a tool\n",
    "3. A feedback loop where posts are revised based on evaluation results\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can work together to produce higher quality results than a single agent working alone. The modular architecture also makes the system more maintainable and extensible.\n",
