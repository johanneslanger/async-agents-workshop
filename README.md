# Async Agents Workshop

This repository contains materials for the "Building Advanced Agents with Strands SDK" workshop. Participants will learn how to build and deploy sophisticated AI agents using the Strands SDK in a practical, hands-on scenario.

## Workshop Scenario

We are a marketing team at **Unicorn-Rentals.AI** - a company that offers unicorns for rent that kids and grown-ups can play with. We are planning to launch a new product feature which allows customers to pick their favorite color of unicorn to rent. Our goal is to automate the social media launch using AI agents.
