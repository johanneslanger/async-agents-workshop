    "\n",
    "Our current implementation has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Execution Time Constraints**: The agent must complete its entire task within the execution time limit of the environment.\n",
    "2. **No Persistence**: If the execution is interrupted, all progress is lost.\n",
    "3. **Blocking Execution**: The client must wait for the entire process to complete before receiving a response.\n",
    "4. **Limited Complexity**: Complex workflows requiring external input or long-running processes are difficult to implement.\n",
